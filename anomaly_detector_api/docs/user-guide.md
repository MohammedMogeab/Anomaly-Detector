# User Guide

Welcome to the Business Logic Anomaly Detector! This comprehensive guide will help you master the platform and conduct effective security testing of web applications.

## üéØ Getting Started

### What is Business Logic Anomaly Detection?

Business logic vulnerabilities are security flaws that occur when an application's workflow can be manipulated to perform unintended actions. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities (like SQL injection), these flaws exploit the intended functionality of an application in unexpected ways.

**Common Examples:**
- Bypassing payment processes by manipulating order workflows
- Accessing admin functions through parameter tampering
- Escalating privileges by modifying user roles
- Skipping authentication steps in multi-step processes

### How the Detector Works

The Business Logic Anomaly Detector uses a sophisticated approach:

1. **Record** legitimate HTTP requests from your application
2. **Generate** modified versions of these requests (test payloads)
3. **Replay** both original and modified requests
4. **Analyze** differences in responses to identify anomalies
5. **Report** potential vulnerabilities with risk assessments

## üè† Dashboard Overview

When you first access the application at `http://localhost:5000`, you'll see the main dashboard with:

### Key Metrics
- **Total Flows**: Number of testing flows created
- **Active Recordings**: Currently recording sessions
- **Anomalies Detected**: Total security issues found
- **Risk Score**: Overall security posture assessment

### Quick Actions
- **Create New Flow**: Start a new testing session
- **Start Recording**: Begin capturing HTTP requests
- **View Latest Results**: Check recent analysis results
- **Generate Report**: Create comprehensive security reports

### Recent Activity
- Timeline of recent testing activities
- Latest anomalies discovered
- System status and health indicators

## üìä Flow Management

Flows are the foundation of your testing activities. Each flow represents a complete security testing session for a specific application or feature.

### Creating a New Flow

1. **Navigate to Flows Section**
   - Click "Flows" in the sidebar navigation

2. **Click "Create New Flow"**
   - Fill in the flow details form

3. **Flow Configuration**
   ```
   Name: E-commerce Checkout Process
   Description: Security testing of the complete purchase workflow including cart management, payment processing, and order confirmation
   Target Domain: shop.example.com
   ```

4. **Best Practices for Flow Names**
   - Use descriptive names that indicate the testing scope
   - Include the application feature being tested
   - Add version numbers for iterative testing

### Managing Existing Flows

**View Flow Details:**

    """Detect successful price manipulation attempts."""
    
    if test_case.category == 'parameter' and 'price' in test_case.description.lower():
        # Check if modified request with negative price succeeded
        if (original_response.status_code == 400 and 
            modified_response.status_code == 200):
            return AnomalyInfo(
